# Introduction

## Building Linux From Scratch: A Beginner’s Roadmap

Discover **Linux From Scratch (LFS)** and learn how to build a custom Linux system from the ground up. This roadmap will guide you step by step, from preparing your knowledge and environment to successfully booting your own LFS system. Each phase includes an *estimated timeframe*, *key resources*, and *best practices*. 

> **Important**: **Follow the official LFS book closely**. Small deviations can cause build issues.[^28][^21-28]

## 1. Prerequisites

### 1.1. Pre-requisites 
**Estimated Duration: 1–2 weeks**

Before diving into LFS, ensure you have a solid foundation in Linux basics and system administration. LFS assumes familiarity with:

- **Command-line tasks**: Navigating directories, copying and moving files, editing text, managing users, etc.  
- **Linux filesystem hierarchy**: Understanding `/etc`, `/usr`, `/bin`, etc., and basic permissions.  
- **Installing software**: Experience with traditional package managers (e.g., Debian’s `apt`, or Red Hat’s `yum/dnf`) is helpful.

> **Tip**: Hands-on practice is essential. Set up a small VM where you can experiment without worry.

---

### 1.2. Package Management Concepts
- Recognize how distros handle software with tools like `apt` or `rpm`.
- Understand that **Linux From Scratch manages packages manually** (via source installations and symbolic links).

---

### 1.3. Compiling Software from Source
- Practice compiling small C programs to understand the *compile → assemble → link* process.[^56][^79–87][^56][^89–97]  
- Use the `gcc` compiler and `make` to build multi-file projects.

<summary>Example: Simple C Program</summary>

```bash
cat <<EOF > hello.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, LFS World!\n");
    return 0;
}
EOF

gcc hello.c -o hello
./hello
# Output: Hello, LFS World!
