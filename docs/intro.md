# Introduction
## Building Linux From Scratch: A Beginner’s Roadmap
Let's discover **Linux from scratch**.

This roadmap will guide you through Linux From Scratch (LFS) step by step, from preparing your knowledge and system to booting your custom Linux and beyond. Each phase includes an estimated timeframe, key resources, and best practices. Following the LFS book closely is critical – deviations can lead to build issues【28†21-28】. Let’s get started!
###



## Prerequisites

### 1. Pre-requisites 
**Estimated Duration: 1–2 weeks**

Before diving into Linux From Scratch (LFS), make sure you have a solid foundation in Linux basics and system administration. LFS assumes you can perform common command-line tasks and have experience installing software<sup>[12†21–29]</sup>. Focus on the following areas:

### 1.1. Linux Fundamentals
- Understand how to navigate directories, copy/move files, edit text, manage users, and use the shell.  
- Get comfortable with the Linux filesystem hierarchy (e.g., what `/etc`, `/usr`, `/bin` are) and basic permissions.

### 1.2. Package Management Concepts
- Know how traditional distributions handle software (e.g., Debian’s APT, RPM) versus installing from source.  
- Recognize how LFS manages this process manually.

### 1.3. Compiling Software from Source
- Practice compiling small programs to understand how source code is converted to binaries: preprocessing, compiling, assembling, and linking stages<sup>[56†79–87][56†89–97]</sup>.  
- Use GCC to compile a simple C program, and use `make` to build a multi-file project.

### 1.4. Bash Scripting & Tools
- Improve your Bash skills: learn how to write simple bash scripts for tasks like backups or text processing.  
- Familiarize yourself with essential tools like `tar`, `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, and text editors (vim/nano).

### 1.5. Dependencies and Linking
- Read about how libraries work (static vs. dynamic linking) and how programs find the libraries they need.  
- Understand why building Glibc early and adjusting the linker is crucial, ensuring that all later programs link against your new Glibc<sup>[33†252–258]</sup>.

### 1.6. Recommended Reading
- **Software-Building HOWTO**<sup>[12†35–43]</sup>  
- **A Beginner’s Guide to Installing Linux Software from Source**<sup>[12†40–48]</sup>  

These resources discuss the generic build/install processes (`configure`, `make`, `make install`) and address common issues.

### 1.7. Best Practices
- Take notes as you learn.  
- Create a checklist of skills and mark them off as you practice.  
- By the end of this phase, you should be comfortable in a terminal-only environment, as the LFS build is entirely command-line based.
